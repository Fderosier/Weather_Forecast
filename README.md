# Weather_Forecast
Description

This code repository features HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that form an interactive weather dashboard for users. By searching for a city, users can access its current weather details (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and climate icon), along with the upcoming five-day forecast. The user's searched cities are saved for convenient access. jQuery is employed in this repository to enable the use of day.js for date establishment. Bootstrap was integrated for styling in this project, marking my initial experience with the framework. While Bootstrap proved beneficial for layout and responsive design, mastering its components and customizations proved challenging. I am eager to delve deeper into Bootstrap for future exploration and learning opportunities.

Credits

In this project, I made use of Day.js documentation to understand date formatting techniques. Additionally, I extensively consulted the Bootstrap documentation to explore various layouts and components. The documentation on Bootstrap's card component was particularly valuable in this regard.

Furthermore, I referred to the documentation provided by the openweather API when working on the fetch functions in the JavaScript code. Their guidance on geocoding and the parameters of the 5-day/3-hour API proved to be particularly useful. For additional details, the complete openweather API documentation is accessible on their website at https://openweathermap.org/forecast5.
